      <h2>About Lithos Explorer</h2>
      <p>Lithos Explorer is one of the most advanced, geologically accurate, and real-world-aware procedural terrain generators ever created for the browser.</p>
      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>We prioritize education above all, incorporating game-like elements as motivators to foster learning through interactive play. Drawing inspiration from simulation games that emphasize authentic geological data and hands-on activities, our app provides an engaging micro-model of Earth for exploration and discovery.</p>
      <h3>Interactive Learning and Exploration</h3>
      <p>Through a blend of procedural generation and real-world data integration, users can dive into geological processes. For example, tweak probabilities to simulate and understand phenomena like subduction zones, promoting deeper educational insights in a fun, visual manner.</p>
      <h3>Discovery Mechanic</h3>
      <p>Experience a Pokédex-style system where you explore to uncover all naturally occurring minerals. Upon discovery, detailed information is provided, making this the pinnacle of interactive learning in our project!</p>
      <h3>Integrated Learning Environment</h3>
      <p>Combined with the ReadEasy Games platform, users gain visual knowledge of the world in the most effective way possible.</p>
